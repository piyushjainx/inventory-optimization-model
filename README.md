# inventory-optimization-model
This project aims to build a model that minimizes inventory costs while ensuring optimal stock levels to meet demand.

1. Project Objectives:
  - Minimize total inventory costs, including:
    - Holding Costs: Cost of storing inventory
    - Ordering Costs: Cost associated with replenishing stock
    - Stockout Costs: Cost of not having inventory when the demand arises
  - Ensure sufficient inventory levels to meet customer demand while avoiding stockouts.
